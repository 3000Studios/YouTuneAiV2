## üí° KEY LEGAL STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE PROTECTION

### A. PATENT STRATEGY
1. **File Provisional ASAP** - Locks in your priority date
2. **Broad Claims** - Cover the core concepts, not just specific code
3. **Multiple Applications** - File continuation patents for improvements
4. **International Filing** - PCT application within 12 months

### B. TRADE SECRET STRATEGY  
1. **Identify Crown Jewels** - What algorithms are most valuable?
2. **Access Controls** - Who can see what parts of the code?
3. **NDAs for Everyone** - Anyone who touches the technology signs NDA
4. **Compartmentalization** - No single person sees the entire system

### C. COPYRIGHT STRATEGY
1. **Register Everything** - All code, documentation, training materials
2. **Digital Signatures** - Prove when code was created
3. **Version Control** - Git commits with detailed descriptions
4. **Licensing Terms** - Clear usage restrictions in all files
